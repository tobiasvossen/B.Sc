## Title
Automatic colorization of gray-value images based on generative algorithms of machine learning and deep neural networks

## Abstract
Generative models create - in contrast to object recognizing models â€“ new con-tent instead of just differentiating between familiar instances. This reveals novel possibilities of data synthesis, which are required whenever it is not useful or even impossible to predict unknown content. The automatic colorization of gray-value images is a prime example for the use of generative models, like a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network), which assigns as part of this work plausible color information to colorless patterns. Deep convolutional neural networks are used, which handle the colorization as a pixel-to-pixel transformation through machine learning. As a result, historical black and white images can be enhanced by applying a suitable color restoration.

## Baseline
