## Title
Automatic colorization of gray-value images based on machine learning and deep generative neural networks

## Abstract
Generative models create - in contrast to object recognising discriminatory models â€“ new content instead of just differentiating between well-known one. This reveals new possibilities of data synthesis, which are needed whenever it is not useful or even impossible to predict unknown content. The automatic colorization of gray-value images is a prime example for the use of a GAN (known as Generative Adversarial Network), which assigns as part of this work plausible color information to hueless patterns. Deep convolutional neural networks are used, which handle the colorization as a pixel-to-pixel transformation by the help of machine learning, with the result of historical black and white images being enhanced by a suitable color restoration.
